## The Store 
The store has two types of customers. 
A regular customer: this customer has a number, name and city. 
There also is a premium customer: he/she is the same as a regular customer, but also has a discount percentage.

All customers have a prefix in the customer number: MM_. This prefix is the same for all customers. 
If this prefix is changed, it should update for ALL the customers. 

* You can get the customer prefix, and the customer number combined.
* A store should hold both types of customers.
* You can fetch all the customers from a certain city.
* It should be possible to remove all the customers with a customer number smaller than a given value.
* Wrote Unit tests for your application.
